# toy-language-interpreter
 Ever wondered how programming languages work under the hood? This Java-based toy language interpreter showcases how code execution happens step by step!

It comes with a simple GUI where you can explore pre-defined programs written using statements like for, switch, while, fork, new, and sleep. The interpreter uses key components like a heap, file table, and symbol table to manage memory, files, and variablesâ€”just like real programming languages!

Since programs are hardcoded, you don't write code inside the app but instead modify them in the source code to see how different features work. This project is part of my portfolio, highlighting my skills in Java, GUI development, and language design!
